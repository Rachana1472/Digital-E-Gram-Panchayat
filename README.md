# Digital-E-Gram-Panchayat
The project aims to improve citizen service delivery in villages by computerizing gram panchayat applications. It provides a web system where users can apply for services and track status online. Admin and staff manage approvals and schemes, ensuring efficient, transparent, and accessible e-services for the community.
